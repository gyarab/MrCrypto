  "sma": "Simple moving average is the unweighted mean of the previous n data. Usualy used for steadily moving charts. FORMULA: SMA = (P1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + ... + PN) / N || PX = price of index X",
  "ema": "Exponential moving average applies weighting factors for previous values and current which decrease exponentially. Usualy used for unstable moving charts. FORMULA: EMA = P * K + EMA(previous) * (1 – K) where P = is current price, K = 2/(N + 1) and N is the number of considered values. because we cant use this formula for first value, we instead use the formula for SMA.",
  "tma": "Triangualr moving average is a simple moving average of a simple moving average, so basically mean of n previous means of previous x data. FORMULA: TMA = (SMA1 + SMA2 + SMA3 + SMA4 + ... + SMAN) / N || SMAX = Simple moving average of index X",
  "wma": "Weighted moving average works as weighted mean of the previous n data. The data are weighted descending from the current value. FORMULA: WMA = (P1 * 5) + (P2 * 4) + (P3 * 3) + (P4 * 2) + (P5 * 1) / (5 + 4+ 3 + 2 + 1) Where PX = price of index X",
  "bob": "Bollinger Bands charaterize volatility and the prices of each data in chart. Bollinger bands shows relative high and low prices of a market fo each data. By definition, prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band. FORMULA:  Upper Band = SMA + (standard deviation of price x 2) * Lower Band = SMA - (standard deviation of price x 2) || Formula for standard deviation is: square root of[(Sum of((P – SMA)^2))/N] where P is current price and N is the number of considered values.
